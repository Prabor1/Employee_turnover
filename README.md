# Employee_turnover

Here I used Decision tree and Random forest to see whether an employee is going to leave the company or not. Finally I added Yellowbrick, a powerful library to plot some nice curve. To make it more useful I added another intersting feature, i.e. intractive plotting for both DT and RF classifier. Which can calculate the turnover with more accuracy because you can change the height, no of estimator in the fly.

I added the source code and dataset as well. The DT model was a little overfitted so finally I used RF which did a good job in predicting this. Finally I Plotted a ROC curve to see how well our model is doing.
